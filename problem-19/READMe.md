### Counting Days

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself. 

- 1 Jan 1990 was Monday
- Thirty days has September, April, June and November. All the rest have thirty-one, Saving February alone, which has twenty-eight, rain or shine. And on leap years, twenty-nine.
- A leap year occurs on year evenly divisible by 4, but not a century unless it is divisble by 400

How many Sundays fell on first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000) ?
