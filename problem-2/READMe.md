# Problem 2

### Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Pseduocode to solve problem
```
Target: (< 4,000,000 && even-valued) of Fibbonacci sequences

1. Fibbonacci sequence:

a=1,b=0,c=0
a+b=c
b=a
a=c

2. Validate a
If a%2==0:
sum += a
```
