# Problem 2

### Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Pseduocode to solve problem
```
Target: (< 4,000,000 && even-valued) of Fibbonacci sequences

1. Fibbonacci sequence:

a=1,b=0,c=0
a+b=c
b=a
a=c

2. Validate a
If a%2==0:
sum += a
```

### Updated Pseudocode

```
first two terms to be 1 and 2, not a = 1, b = 0

init a=1,b=2,sum=0
while a<4000000:
    if a is even (a%2==0):
        add a to sum
    update a and b to the next fibbonacci number:
    a,b = b, a+b
Print sum
```
