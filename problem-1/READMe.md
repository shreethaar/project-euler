# Problem 1

### Multiple of 3 or 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. 

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000

### Pseudocode to solve problem

Start from 1000, loop it down until 3
1. multiples of 3: (A % 3 == 0)
2. multiples of 5: (B % 5 == 0)

Sum += [If (A % 3 ==0)] + [If (B % 5 ==0)]
