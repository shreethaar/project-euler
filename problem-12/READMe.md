# Problem 12

### Highly Divisible Triangular Number

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28. The first ten terms would be:

`1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,...`

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
```
1: 1
3: 1,3
6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
```

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

### Solution:
- function to count divisors which iterate from 1 to sqrt(num)
- generate triangular number where `n*(n+1)/2`, also increment by n for iterating
- stop loop exection once reach 500

### Pseudocode:

```
div_count(num):
    count=0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(num):
        if num%i==0:
            count+=2
        if i*i==num:
            count--
    return count

n=1
while true:
    tri_num=n*(n+1)/2
    func_div_count=div_count(tri_num)
    if func_div_count>500:
        print tri_num
        break
    n++
```
